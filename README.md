# Refactor Playground

This repository is a **learning and experimentation space** inspired by Martin Fowler's book  
**_"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"_**.

The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate **refactoring techniques** that improve
the structure and maintainability of existing code **without changing its external behavior**.

---

## 📖 What’s inside?
- Hands-on examples from the book implemented in **Java**.
- Before vs. After refactoring comparisons.
- Usage of **unit tests** to ensure behavior remains consistent.
- Application of **design principles & patterns** (where appropriate).

---
