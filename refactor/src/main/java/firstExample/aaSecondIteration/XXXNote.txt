As I look at amountFor, I can see that it uses information from the rental,
but does not use information from the customer.
This immediately raises my suspicions that the method is on the wrong object.
In most cases a method should be on the object whose data it uses, thus the method should be moved to the rental.
To do this I use
:: Move Method

The next thing that strikes me is that thisAmount is now redundant.
It is set to the result of each.charge and not changed afterward.
Thus I can eliminate thisAmount by using
:: Replace Temp with Query

I like to get rid of temporary variables such as this as much as possible.
Temps are often a problem in that they cause a lot of parameters to be passed around when they donâ€™t have to be.
You can easily lose track of what they are there for. They are particularly insidious in long methods.
